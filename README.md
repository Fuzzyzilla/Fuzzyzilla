## Hi, I'm Aspen 🐑

An open-source critter with a particular interest in graphics programming and a propensity for tiny native software.

In building my [funny art program](https://github.com/Fuzzyzilla/fuzzpaint), I hope to modularize my work and contribute it back to the greater open-source community who's collective work makes my projects possible in the first place!

🦀 Type-level safety my beloved 🦀
